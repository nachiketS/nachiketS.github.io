ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Nachiket Sirsikar. I'm a software engineer/ data engineer/ data scientist/analyst and a computer 
  science student. Currently I'm pursuing my graduate degree from Northeastern University.

  With a strong background in computer science and a keen interest in data analysis, I've developed an interest in
  building systems that enable using data for building effective systems, especially the engineering challenge that
  comes from trying to solve this problem.

  Throughout my education and professional experience, I have honed my skills in data warehousing,
  ETL, and SQL. I am also proficient in programming languages such as Python and Java.
  I have experience working with big data technologies such as Spark and HBase and I have a deep understanding 
  of data modeling and data governance.

  I am also interested in the field of operations, including DataOps, MLOps, and DevOps.
  I am currently exploring these areas and gaining more experience in them.
  Furthermore, I have a keen interest in computer vision and its applications 
  and I am currently experimenting with this field as well.

  I am excited to continue building my skills and knowledge in this field and I am eager to apply my expertise 
  to help organizations make data-driven decisions. 

  I invite you to explore my portfolio to see examples of my work, and don't hesitate to contact me 
  if you have any questions or if you want to discuss any opportunities.
